# Huffman Coding Console Application

## Project Overview

This Java console application implements file encoding and decoding using the Huffman coding algorithm. Huffman coding is an efficient data compression technique that utilizes variable-length codes to represent symbols in the original file.

## How to Run the Project

The project supports the following execution modes:

- **encode**: Encode a file.
- **decode**: Decode a compressed file.
- **info**: Obtain information about a compressed file.

### Usage Examples:

```bash
java Main encode Files/test.txt
java Main decode test.arc
