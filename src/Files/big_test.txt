Объемный пример на анлийском:
Now, I’m going to give a talk about an amazing time called the digital age. Humanity
has been talking about rapid progress in the field of technology for several decades in a row,
but the pace of this development does not decrease, and all new discoveries are shaking the
world. A significant figure of this time was the American mathematician Claude Shannon,
who is the founder of information theory. The main concept of his research was that
information can be quantitatively encoded as a series of ones and zeros. His ideas became
breakthroughs in the field of technologies related to information and later Shannon
developed them to the level of great science. The 1970s were the period of the digital
revolution. The advent and widespread adoption of personal computers and the development
of the Internet, also called the World Wide Web were the reasons the turning point was
underway. More technological changes, such as the development of fiber optic cables and
faster microprocessors, accelerated the transmission and processing of information.
The advent of computers in the 20th century laid the modern groundwork for smart
machines. Related technological advancements such as the internet, data storage systems and
sensors, gave computer developers the ability to collect and analyze an unprecedented
volume of data toward the turn of the century, further speeding the rise of smart machines.
As a matter of fact, smart machine is a device embedded with machine-to-machine and
cognitive computing technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning or deep
learning, all of which it uses to reason, problem-solve, make decisions and even, ultimately,
act. Smart machines include robots, self-driving cars and other cognitive computing systems
that are designed to work through tasks without human intervention. To sum up, today’s
smart machines might seem revolutionary, it is the next step in a long history of incremental
advancements in machines and computing. Smart machines can be regarded as digital
disruptors because of the positive and negative impact they have, and will continue to have,
on society. In particular, in business, the competitive advantages these technologies are
capable of providing are expected to bring higher profit margins and lead to more efficient
manufacturing processes. However, smart machines are also expected to displace workers
and dramatically change the nature of work and other societal norms.
Robotic workers and self-driving cars are not the only things that technological advances
can surprise us with. Think about a smart city, imagine what it could be. In fact, there is no
need to imagine, such cities are already a reality. Nevertheless, what makes a city smart?
There are three layers which work together to make a smart city operate. The first layer is a
technology base that includes a critical mass of smartphones and sensors connected by
highspeed communication networks. A second layer of specific applications translates the
constant stream of raw data into alerts, insights, and action. The third application,
participation from the public, may be the most important. Apps that show traffic volume in
real time, for instance, allow drivers and pedestrians to better plan travel routes and adapt at
a moment’s notice. That capability speeds along every process. Moreover, dozens of
applications are already available in each of the developing areas. Real-time crime mapping,
for instance, helps in policing; telemedicine brings health practitioners into patients’ homes;
digital tracking of waste receptacles tells a garbage hauler when a can is full. The list goes
on.
Finally, these technologies are amazing, as is the level of progress that we have
achieved along with them. Progress is a very interesting word that stands for ascent from
something lower to higher. Because of progress, people become smarter, people improve,
their brain itself works in a completely different way. Think what a great life we have. We
work every day and try to present something to the world. Thanks to such a life, we can
invent new things and improve ourselves.
